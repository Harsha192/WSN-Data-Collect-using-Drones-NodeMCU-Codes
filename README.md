# WSN-Data-Collect-using-Drones-NodeMCU-Codes
NodeMCU codes for sensor node and moving base station.
Base station have the access-point for sensor node to connect.
Sensor node scanning for base station's access-point.
When it is in the range, sensor node start sending data to base station.
When base station not in the range, sensor node sensing physical data while scanning for the access-point.
Two threads are used for these two tasks.
